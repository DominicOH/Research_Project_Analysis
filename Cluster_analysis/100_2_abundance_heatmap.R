# Concept ----

# Rather than using Euclidean distances of the total of each point, it's 
# informative to see how proteins are clustered with regard to the rate of 
# change or correlation. The same concept can be applied to apical / basal. 

# Going to use Euclidean averages as the default means of clustering and 
# measuring distance between points. 

# Dataframe ----

# The purpose of this is to find the Pearson correlation of protein abundances 
# for each other protein in the dataframe.
# Code for this section is derived in part from Watson (2015).
# Performs a hierarchical cluster model from the matrix above. 

# dend_expend finds the optimal clustering and distance algorithm. 
# As I decided to use a Pearson correlation based approach, the most optimal
# algorithm turns out to be Euclidean Average.
# By contrast, in the base abundance_df, Euclidean Complete is marginally better

# Useful to save the hierarchical cluster data separately
